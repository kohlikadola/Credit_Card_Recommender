# Credit_Card_Recommender
This project is a semantic and heuristic-based credit card recommendation system. It leverages **LLama 3** through **Ollama** for semantic extraction of card details and combines it with a custom heuristic comparator for more personalized and precise recommendations.

The tool supports both a Command Line Interface (CLI) and a Frontend User Interface (UI) built using Streamlit.
